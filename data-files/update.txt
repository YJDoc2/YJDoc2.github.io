- Improve light mode : not green+pink

- Shorten landing page to no-scroll, and quick links to rest of pages

- Move technologies on home page to abouut page

-> About page
	As shot as possible ; maybe skip the tech stack altogether, and instead use tags
	Add Short intro
	Add experience (Falkonry,youki, logrocket,Unicode)
	Add Academics

-> Contact page
	Make content centered (?), let it take more space
	Add "Opportunities"

-> Projects page
	Redo completely
	clean up the search, make tag based instead
	Separate out projects into their own projects
	Add more details for each, pics too
	Maybe try re-arranging, not in list (grid?)

-> Blog page
	Add main blog page listing all blogs
	individual blog pages
	tag based
	add meta, canonical link for logrocket posts

-> Live pages
	blogs (general)
	specific blog posts
	YT channels
	YT videos
	
Routing scheme :
/ -> landing
/about 
/contact
/projects
/projects/[project]
/blogs
/blogs/[slug]
/livepages
/livepages/*(?)
