# About Me

I'm a curious student with interest in low level systems such as operating systems, compilers and other system-software. I like to learn new things, and help others learn things if I can. I try to focus on maintainability and debuggablity when I write code, because I like both of them! I also like to create documentation - both for developers and users - as I go along ; because we are going to forget  why we added that line of code six months later ;)

Apart from that, I am also fascinated by physics , specifically the General Theory of Relativity. I feel it's a really beautiful theory, and one day I hope to learn enough maths to actually understand it :) That said, I do think that Sets are one of the most profound things in maths. starting with almost nothing and then building almost everything from that. Come to think of it, I like maths as well.

There are some more pages on this site which have more info on my reading list, shows etc. but here's a short version :

- I love Discworld by Terry Pratchett OBE
- I really like Faster Fene series and the translated works of Jules Verne by Bha. Ra. Bhagwat
- My favourite anime right now are Mob Psycho 100 and A place further than the Universe

I am interested in hearing about interesting opportunities and projects, feel free to contact me. Thanks for visiting!
