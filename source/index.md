Hello! Nice to see you here :)

I am __Yashodhan__, a curious person interested in operating systems, systems-programming and reading. Apart from several projects and open source contributions, I also have professional experience in the field of dev-ops and systems-engineering.

You can check out more details about me on the {% url_for About about %} page, and find some of the projects I did on {% url_for Showcase showcase %} Page. List of my occasional blogs posts, which cover topics such as C, Rust and JS can be found in the {% url_for archives archives %}.


I am open for new, interesting ideas and opportunities, feel free to {% url_for "reach out" contact %} to me.

Hope you have a good time!
