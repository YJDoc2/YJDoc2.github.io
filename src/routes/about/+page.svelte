	<p class="text-xl">
		I'm a curious person with interest in low level systems such as operating systems, compilers and other system-software.
		I like to learn new things, and help others learn things if I can. I try to focus on maintainability and debuggablity when I write code,
		because I like both of them! I also like to create documentation - both for developers and users - as I go along ; because we are going to forget 
		why we added that line of code six months later ;)
	</p>
	<p class="text-xl">
		Apart from that, I am also fascinated by physics , specifically the General Theory of Relativity. I feel it's a really beautiful theory, and one day
		I hope to learn enough maths to actually understand it :) That said, I do think that Sets are one of the most profound things in maths. starting with
		almost nothing and then building almost everything from that. Come to think of it, I like maths as well.

		I like reading, mostly for fun. Some of my favorites are<br />
		- <b>Faster Fene</b> series by <b>Bha. Ra. Bhagvat</b> <br/>
		- Marathi version of <b>Jules Verne , Translated</b> by <b>Bha. Ra. Bhagvat</b> <br />
		- <b>Discowrld</b> Series by <b>Sir Prof. Terry Pratchett</b> <br />
		To list a few. If you are a booklover, you know how hard it is to list only three! I am going to list more at TODO, so feel free to check that out.
