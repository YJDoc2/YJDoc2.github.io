			I am a curious person interested in operating systems, compilers and system-programming. I
			have done several projects in related domains, and have professional experience in dev-ops and
			system-engineering.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have written and currently maintain an <a href="TODO">Intel 8086 emulator</a> which was used
			many students across the world, as well as has been used by several professors to conduct
			their classes. I have also written a library which helps in writing software emulated hardware
			components. To know more about my projects you can check out the
			<a href="/projects"> projects </a>page.
		</p>
		<p>
			Apart from my personal projects, I also have done contributions to various open source
			projects. Currently I am one of the maintainers of a low-level container runtime
			<a href="https://github.com/containers/youki" target="_blank">Youki</a>. I have professional
			experience in implementing and maintaining CI/CD and various in-house dev-tools and bots at
			<a href="TODO">Falkonry</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also write occasional blogs on various topics ranging from beginner level tutorials for
			Rust, node JS etc. to in-depth exploring of code compilation. You can check them out on the
			<a href="/blogs">blogs</a> page.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can find more about me on the <a href="/about"> About </a> page. As you will find out
			there, I am interested in hearing about new, interesting ideas. So if you want to talk about
			that, or anything else, feel free to <a href="/contact"> Contact Me</a>.
